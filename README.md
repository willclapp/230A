This repository contains code to run a stripped-down version of the experiment connected to my Intro to Semantics and Pragmatics final project. To see a working version of the experiment, go to:

https://willclapp.github.io/200A/exp.html

The experiment currently consists of only 8 trials in each run (two instances of each of the four quantificational determiners, and one with each focus condition). A full version of the experiment would also contain 32 filler trials. The audio in this version would also be preliminary. A real implementation of this experiment would of course need to have well-recorded stimuli with normalized intonation patterns. 


The experiment should be run from the exp.html file, but the main experiment procedure is in exp.js. The procedure makes heavy use of the jsPsych library, which can be found here.
