This repository contains code to run a stripped-down version of the experiment connected to my Intro to Semantics and Pragmatics final project. To see a working version of the experiment, go to:

The experiment currently consists of only 8 trials in each run (two instances of each of the four quantificational determiners, and one with each focus condition). A full version of the experiment would also contain 32 filler trials. The audio in this version would also be preliminary. A real implementation of this experiment would of course need to have well-recorded stimuli with normalized intonation patterns.
